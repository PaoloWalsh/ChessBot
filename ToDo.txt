Finish piece move rules:
	->add piece promotion

transpose gameboard for player 2 to play the move

add style to the board and background

add a login

add a game log for different users


Promotion:
	-> need to store queens in array as well, do I create global variables for each piece I add?
		How do I name this variables?
	-> What promt do I give?	

makeMove():
	->the function should make the move html wise and should call all the other important functions
	->it should be what dragDrop is now
	->after I added this function I can add multiple events to move the pieces and they will all call this function
	->for example onClick with a global variable to know if it was the first or second click. On the first click I just update the variable, on the second I call makeMove and if all goes well I update the variable
